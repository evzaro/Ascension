# Ascension #

Ascension is a soothing, yet difficult 'platform jumper' type game roughly based on 'Winter Bells'. 
It becomes increasingly challenging as the player progresses.

Ascension was built with HTML5 canvas and JavaScript.

### Optimization ###

* Two HTML5 canvas elements are used in order to increase performance. 
* The primary game sprites are drawn in one canvas, and the scrolling background is drawn in another.

### Gameplay ###

* Simply use your mouse or trackpad to move the bunny. 
* Continue your ascent and increase your score by hopping on fruits and veggies. 
* As your score increases, the fruits/veggies grow smaller.

### Scoring ###

* Each fruit/veggie that the bunny touches adds points to your score.
* The fruits/veggies are originally worth 10 points. They increase in value with each hop.

### Art ###

* I drew the endlessly scrolling background in Adobe Photoshop.
* Fruit and vegetable sprites were produced by [http://thisisellian.deviantart.com/](ThisIsEllian).
